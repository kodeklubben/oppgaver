# LKK_auto_linter
#
# Usage: First allow the script to be run
#
#   chmod +x ./LKK_auto_linter.sh
#
# Now you can run the script on any markdown (md) file
#

# Explanation of options given to perl:
#
# -i                                    Modifies your input file in-place (making a backup of
#                                       the original). Handy to modify files without the {copy,
#                                       delete-original, rename} process.
#
# -e                                    Allows you to provide the program as an argument rather
#                                       than in a file. You don't want to have to create a script
#                                       file for every little Perl one-liner.
#
#  0                                    Read the entire file (unlike line by line)
#
# -p                                    Places a printing loop around your command so
#                                       that it acts on each line of standard input.
