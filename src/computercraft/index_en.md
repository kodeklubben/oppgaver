ComputerCraft is a mod of Minecraft that gives you the opportunity to build and
program computers and robots inside the Minecraft world. Inside Minecraft we
program in a language that is called Lua, which is similar to Python. Check it

These tasks require neither knowledge of programming nor Minecraft, but one or
both will probably make this even more exciting!
