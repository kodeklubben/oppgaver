A computer can do a lot of things that is not possible to do in a graphical user
interface, but is possible if we code a bit in the command line. Here you'll
find projects, tutorials and videos where you get an insight into what's
possible to to.

This is a little more advanced than most other courses on this page, and it is
recommended to have knowledge of, for example, Python, Processing, Arduino or
Java before trying this.
