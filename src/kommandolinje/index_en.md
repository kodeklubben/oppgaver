A computer can do a lot of things that is not possible to do in a graphical
user interface, but is possible if we code a bit in the command line. Here
you'll find projects, tutorials and videos where you get an insight into what's
possible to to. This is a little more advanced than most other courses on
this page, and it is recommended to have knowledge of, for example, Python,
Processing, Arduino or Java before trying this.
